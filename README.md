# PreviousSemesters

Time changes us, but it doesn't change course numbers.

So that each now section has a fresh start, the contents of this GitHub organization (@4620) always contain the code for the most recent iteration of this course. However, I always maintain this repository with zipped content from previous semesters. 

If you are a previous student, don't hestitate to drop by or drop me a line. You are just as important to me now as you were in my class.
